# Particle_trajectory
## 1. Introduction
This code serves as a particle trajectory simulator, which interfaces with steady-state CFD simulations (one-way coupling). Given its implementation of a general drag coefficient model, this code is adept at handling supersonic flow problems. The simulator can directly utilize OpenFOAM mesh geometry files and field profiles as input structures, without necessitating any modifications. While results from Fluent CFD can also be used, they must first be converted to the OpenFOAM format. A converter for this transformation is included in this repository.
